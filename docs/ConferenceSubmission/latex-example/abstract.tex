\begin{abstract}
This is my abstract.  I usually keep these short and too the point
(around 200-300 words).  You don't have to cite anything -- in fact it
is considered poor form to cite things in your abstract -- but you do
need to give the reader an idea about what you did.  It is also a good
idea to put numbers in your abstract.
